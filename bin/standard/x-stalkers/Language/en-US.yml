At some point we're going to have enough resources and engaging in every single encounter won't be necessary."
  STR_MAIN_BASE: "Our Main Base"
  STR_CQC: "Close Quarters"
  STR_CQC_KNOWLEDGEBASE1: "When you try to get close to the guy and go for a meatshot, he's not just gonna stand there and take it. He'll try to push the barrel away, and the shot will whiff. Which means, that the OXCE CQC mechanic is enabled. But the default formula for CQC check is - I'm gonna say it - {ALT}poyebana{ALT}. Or more like {ALT}popierdolona{ALT}. So in the Zone the CQC formula goes like this:{NEWLINE}  - Base chance of having your gun pushed away depends on weapon inventory size. For 1x2 weapons {ALT}20%{ALT}, for 2x2 and 1x3 weapons {ALT}50%{ALT}, for 3x2 weapons {ALT}80%{ALT}.{NEWLINE}  - If defender is being shot in the back, substract {ALT}30%{ALT}{NEWLINE}  - Then you take {ALT}REACTIONS{ALT} diffrence between units, multiply it by 2 and add/substract it from base chance in favour of whoever has more{NEWLINE}  - If attacker has more {ALT}STRENGTH{ALT}, substract strength diffrence.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Point blank shots deal 100-150% damage. It might make sense to have a pistol on you."
  STR_CQC_KNOWLEDGEBASE2: "If you're curious, the default CQC formula works like this:{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE} - To win at CQC, {ALT}you{ALT} have to win a melee roll, not the guy attempting to grab the barrel. He can be high on kokainum, have no hands or be braindead. He's safe, as long as you miss a melee roll (you will).{NEWLINE} - Base chance of success is (MELEE + REACTIONS)/2. Close to zero for X-COM operatives.{NEWLINE} - Here you put several configurable CQC related settings that make it even worse.{NEWLINE} - Wounded hands matter.{NEWLINE} - Whatever near-zero% chance to hit you have at this point, substract victim's armor's melee dodge from it.{NEWLINE} - If the roll fails, you lose at CQC.{NEWLINE} - At this point you're better off shooting {ALT}away{ALT} from the target and have your barrel CQC-pushed {ALT}towards{ALT} the target.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{ALT}Popierdolona.{ALT}"
  STR_DRUNK_DEBUFF: "Drunk Debuff"
  STR_DRUNK_DEBUFF_KNOWLEDGEBASE: "Drinking alcohol has a drawback. Just like real life. Each stack of drunk debuff lowers your accuracies and reactions by 5% and increases stun damage taken at the beginning of a turn. On the other hand each stack increases bravery by 5. Those stacks go away with each turn so you eventually sober up if the battle goes on for long enough."

Detection range is reduced to 10 tiles in light, 6 in dark (may vary depending on outfit). Squatting lowers it even more, by 3 tiles. On beginning of next turn stealh will still be active, but it will expire unless you either remain still, or activate it again before moving.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Melee hits while sneaking deal guaranteed 300% damage."
  STR_MEASURE_DISTANCE: "Measure distance"
  STR_MEASURE_DISTANCE_KNOWLEDGEBASE: "With this skill you won't have to manually count individual squares to see if you are about to sneak inside enemy's sight cone without getting spotted. Activate the aiming mode and the accuracy will correspond to number of tiles between your stalker and target tile."
  STR_AIM_HEAD: "Aim for the head"
  STR_AIM_HEAD_KNOWLEDGEBASE: "You can spend more time units on shooting to increase the odds of hitting the head. Head is unarmored and it takes more damage. Usually. But even with helmet, stun damage from headshots is doubled."

First it rolls 50-150% of base damage, multiplies it by armor's resistance to given damage type, substracts it by armor value of direction hit and whatever punched through armor damages health, stun and so on. And also adds 0-3 fatal wounds. Most damage types have a gimmick.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{ALT}BALLISTIC{ALT} - ...except for this one. Everything standard.{NEWLINE}{ALT}FIRE{ALT} - Ignores armor values and deals 5-15 damage (reduced by resistance). Being set on fire or standing on fire tile also deals 5-15 damage at beginning of turn. Like you would expect from this engine.{NEWLINE}{ALT}HIGH EXPLOSIVE{ALT} - Has area of effect, but the damaging formula is standard."
  STR_DMG_TYPES_KNOWLEDGEBASE2: "{ALT}Page [2/3]{ALT}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{ALT}LASER{ALT} - High damage values make it easy to pierce armor, but it tends to cauterize the wound in the process. Deals only 50% health damage and causes no fatal wounds.{NEWLINE}{ALT}PLASMA{ALT} - Sets on fire{NEWLINE}{ALT}ELECTRIC{ALT} - Ignores armor values and all the damage goes to stun. It also drains time units, making it difficult for target to do reaction fire. And if target already doesn't have any TUs, it starts its next turn with less TUs according to damage taken. Causes no fatal wounds.{NEWLINE}{ALT}RUPTURE{ALT} - causes +1 more fatal wound on every hit that deals health damage.{NEWLINE}"
  STR_DMG_TYPES_KNOWLEDGEBASE3: "{ALT}Page [3/3]{ALT}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{ALT}ACID{ALT} - Attacks of this type have low power, but 100% of damage goes directly to armor (ToArmorPre). And once armor is completely corroded, 100% damage goes to fatal wounds (instead of regular 0-3).{NEWLINE}{ALT}SMOKE{ALT} - Also ignores armor. Careful, stun damage from smoke inhalation is much greater than you are used to from X-COM.{NEWLINE}{ALT}IMPACT{ALT} - Ignores armor, deals 100% stun damage, 25% health damage, 20% stamina damage, causes no fatal wounds.{NEWLINE}{ALT}RADIATION{ALT} - Also ignores armor values, but damage goes to radiation (Represented with the green bar in the UI)"
